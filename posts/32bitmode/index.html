<pre tabindex="0"><code> Well for our operating system to make the switch from 16 bit to 32 bit we need to do some preparations, that involves saying good bye to the BIOS, setting up the GDT and making a lot of bugs while trying to make a driver for the keyboard.
</code></pre><h3 id="-gdt"><code>=&gt; GDT:</code></h3>
<pre tabindex="0"><code> We used segmentation before in 16 bit mode, but here things work differently, in 32 bit we need to define The Global Descriptor Table(GDT), which is a structure where we define the descriptor of the segment we use, it&#39;s contains various properties and flags that define how and what our segment will do, will we be able to read it ? or to write to it ?...
</code></pre><h3 id="-gdt--memory-models"><code>=&gt; GDT &amp;&amp; Memory Models:</code></h3>
<pre tabindex="0"><code> The GDT allow us to define and use different memory models from which:
 
 - Flat memory model: This model uses physical addresses. In the flat memory model memory is viewed as a contiguous address space, starting from 0 and going up to the maximum address. Those addresses correspond directly to the physical locations of memory in the RAM, this makes memory access simple, but also makes implementing memory protection harder, cause all programs have equal access to the intire memory space.
 
 - Segmentation: Here the memory is divided into smaller sections called segments. each of them can be assigned different access privileges. So segmentation provides a form of memory safety by allowing us to asign different access privilege (read-only for example) to each segment, but also add more overhead, as the processor must keep track of segment register values and switch between segments as needed.
 
 - Paging: This is a more advenced form od memory management that devides memory into fixed-size pages (typically ranging from 4KB to 8KB in size), ad maps these pages to the virtual memory addresses used by the operating system and applications. This allows for more control over memory access and used to implement virtual memory, where a program can access a larger adress space than is physically available by temporarily swapping pages of memory from and to the disk.
 
 So while paging offers the most protection, it&#39;s also a way more complexed than the flat memory model, while segmentation is between the two models, providing some protection while relatively simple to implement. In YonaOS we will go for the flat memory model for now, I do trust you, and your skills as a programmer, and provide you with the full privilege of the whole RAM.

<pre><code>- Base Address (32 bit): The starting address of a segment.

- Limit (20 bits): The size of the segment.

- Access rights (8 bit): defines the access rights for the segment, such as read, write, and execute permissions.

- Flags (4 bits): additional flags that specify the properties of the segment.

<pre><code>Well understanding what a GDT is a thing and defining it is an other, well you can visit the source code in YonaOS and find out how wierd it's to declare it, for example instead of declaring the address base (32 bit), you need to define 16 bit from the limit (20 bit), then define 24 bit of the base, and it's a miss, I don't know why it should be like this a joke ? revenge ? who knows.
